MERN Book Search Engine

This is a book search engine which has been refactored to use GraphQL API instead of RESTful APIs for more dynamic querying processes. The front-end functionality remains the same, except queries and data modification are made via a GraphQL API which allows more flexibility in the data that is managed.

A deployed demo of the newly refactored search engine can be viewed [here]{https://quiet-savannah-41637.herokuapp.com/).
